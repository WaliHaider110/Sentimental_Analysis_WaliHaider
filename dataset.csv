Upgraded Bluetooth Cancelling Headphones Hands Free,Aux Jack has poor connection and keeps cutting out audio,"This is the second Bluetooth adapter I?ve used for my car, and after only using it for a couple of weeks it?s already having issues. The audio keeps cutting out frequently for a couple of seconds at a time which was never an issue with my previous adapter. It seems like the auxiliary jack has a poor connection with the auxiliary input, and it seems like maybe it?s getting loose and losing contact causing the breaks in audio. I?ve tried shifting it around but the issue continues. I?m using the short adapter instead of the longer cable, which I would prefer not to use since it?s less convenient to access while driving. Everything else about it works fine.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"November 16, 2022",Amber Smith,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEYVM7FDZO3GV4D3UOMCTMOLWKEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE

Upgraded Bluetooth Cancelling Headphones Hands Free,It?s Subpar,"I bought this because it was the most popular and had a pretty good overall rating. Unfortunately this just isn?t a well-built product. Sometimes the device itself will start to rattle loudly while driving, and as far as the buttons on the side go to change the song you have to press them 3 to 4 times to get the song to change. The other thing I?m also not a fan of is the blue light on the side. It blinks the entire time you?re using the device & can be pretty distracting while driving at night.

Upgraded Bluetooth Cancelling Headphones Hands Free,Shaky connection,"Turns on and connects to phone easily, but the connection sound staticky at times and I often have to hold the device in place if I want to listen.

Upgraded Bluetooth Cancelling Headphones Hands Free,Mostly Okay,"I bought a this item January 2022 & it?s been mostly pretty decent with decent sound quality with one exception. The first of my two issues is that I can here some low level squealing, some days it gets pretty annoying and I just give up and switch to radio. The second issue is recently (August 2022) the device refuses to power on and I?m unable to use it? a few days go by and then it will turn on again. If I could resolve the noise bleeding through and have it power on reliabily I would use it none stop. It?s honestly not to bad when using it for phone calls.PS: the aux-cable seems to work better than the solid plug (less squealing). It would also be cool if these came with some Velcro to help install it onto the dash.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"August 14, 2022",GLShoulders2,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFX2UPHXNRFXIMP5ZMSLYGEYIDQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,TRUE
